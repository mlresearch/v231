abstract: Complex systems are characterized by intricate interactions between entities
  that evolve dynamically over time. Accurate inference of these dynamic relationships
  is crucial for understanding and predicting system behavior. In this paper, we propose
  Regulatory Temporal Interaction Network Inference (RiTINI) for inferring time-varying
  interaction graphs in complex systems using a novel combination of space-and-time
  graph attentions and graph neural ordinary differential equations (ODEs). RiTINI
  leverages time-lapse signals on a graph prior, as well as perturbations of signals
  at various nodes in order to effectively capture the dynamics of the underlying
  system. This approach is distinct from traditional causal inference networks, which
  are limited to inferring acyclic and static graphs. In contrast, RiTINI can infer
  cyclic, directed, and time-varying graphs, providing a more comprehensive and accurate
  representation of complex systems. The graph attention mechanism in RiTINI allows
  the model to adaptively focus on the most relevant interactions in time and space,
  while the graph neural ODEs enable continuous-time modeling of the system’s dynamics.
  We evaluate RiTINI’s performance on simulations of dynamical systems, neuronal networks,
  and gene regulatory networks, demonstrating its state-of-the-art capability in inferring
  interaction graphs compared to previous methods.
